# Developer problems on AWS

• Managing infrastructure
• Deploying Code
• Configuring all the databases, load balancers, etc
• Scaling concerns

# AWS Elastic Beanstalk Overview 

• Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
• It uses all the component’s we’ve seen before: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, etc...
• We still have full control over the configuration
• Beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances

Elastic Beanstalk Managed service - Instance configuration / OS is handled by Beanstalk, Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by Elastic Beanstalk, capacity, load balancing, auto scaling, app health monitoring and responsiveness

Developer responsibility - just the applicatio code!
