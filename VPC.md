we can go to subnets to view- private and public subnets
private/public IP iwll have CIDR range example:172.31.48.0/20- so is any of 0-20 ip is available we can assign it to our application/instance while creating them
each availability zone will have VPC which in turn will hav erange of CIDR(Range of IP's) where we can craete our instance
